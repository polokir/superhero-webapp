● Create, edit and remove a superhero  #(+)


○ When creating / editing we want to be able to assign and remove images from
a superhero #(+/-)


● List all the superheros, seeing only one image for each and it’s nickname,
with pagination, showing 5 items at once #(+)


● See the details of one particular superhero with all it’s information and images #(+/-)


The main problem was uploading the **set** of images. Now in application you can upload only **one** picture of hero.
